1. Setup Phase:

- Create Docker environment

  - Write Dockerfile with all dependencies
  - Include PyTorch, transformers, TRL, python-chess
  - Test build locally
  - Verify all components work in container

- Basic Testing in Docker

  - Test Stockfish integration
  - Verify model loading
  - Test basic reward computation
  - Ensure environment consistency

- RunPod Setup
  - Create RunPod account
  - Test SSH and development flow
  - Upload Docker environment
  - Verify all components work same as local

2. Initial Testing:

- Small-scale test with Stockfish
- Verify reward computation
- Test basic RL loop

3. Full Implementation:

- Scale up to full training
- Monitor and adjust
