## Project Overview

This project aims to build a **chess reasoner** using a purely **rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)** approach—drawing inspiration from methods like DeepSeek-R1 in which a model is incentivized to produce detailed “chain-of-thought” reasoning. We begin with an existing 7B-parameter base language model and integrate a reward mechanism that relies solely on programmatic checks:

1. **Chess Engine Evaluation** – We use Stockfish (or another engine) to assess the quality of moves.
2. **Chain-of-Thought Formatting** – We reward the model for placing its reasoning in `<think></think>` tags and providing a final move in `<answer></answer>`.
3. **Group-based PPO/GRPO** – We generate multiple responses per board state, compute a reward for each, and then update the policy by comparing how each response fares relative to the group average.
4. **Potentially other rewards to encourage cot length** -- Need more research on this to ensure it will not be exploited.

Through iterative training, the model learns to:

- Produce valid, reasonably strong chess moves,
- Provide readable, step-by-step reasoning (chain of thought) for its move choices,
- Improve its behavior without relying on any supervised fine-tuning data.

The end goal is to replicate the _RL-only_, “self-evolving” approach—where correctness and formatting are rewarded—thus encouraging the model to refine its chess knowledge and reasoning skills purely from the reward signals, much like **DeepSeek-R1-Zero** did for math/coding tasks. This README contains the essential setup steps, from choosing libraries and hardware to defining prompts and configuring the training loop.

# Initial Setup for a Chess RL Project with a 7B Model

Below is a concise checklist to get started on a GRPO-like RL pipeline for chess, using a 7B LLM and Stockfish.

---

## 1. Environment & Libraries

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
  - For loading a 7B pre-trained model and handling text generation.
- **Hugging Face TRL** (or a fork/alternative that supports group-based PPO)
  - For the RL loop (sampling, advantage calculation, policy updates).
- **PyTorch (GPU-enabled)**
  - Core deep-learning framework.
- **Stockfish (or Another Chess Engine)**
  - For evaluating the model’s proposed moves and providing numeric rewards.
  - Install via a system package or a Python wrapper (e.g., `pip install python-chess`) which can interface with Stockfish.

---

## 2. Hardware / Compute

- **GPUs**
  - Cloud or on-premise. At least one high-memory GPU if possible (e.g., 24GB+), since a 7B model can be large in VRAM.
- **Multi-GPU or Distributed Setup (Optional)**

  - If you want faster RL training, consider multi-GPU (e.g., using DeepSpeed or another parallel framework).

  ### Cloud Options:

  ✅ RunPod Pros:

- Simple setup
- Pay-per-use
- Good GPU options (A100s, H100s)
- Docker-based (portable)
- SSH access

❌ GCP/Azure Cons:

- Complex setup
- Ongoing costs
- More overhead

## 3. Data / Prompts

- **Chess Positions**

  - You’ll feed the model positions in PGN notation (or a simple textual description).

- **Prompt Format**

  - "Board PGN: <pgn_here>\nThink step by step (in <think></think>) about the next move.\nProvide final move in <answer></answer>."

- **Multiple Samples per Position**
  - For each position, you’ll sample _G_ responses from the old policy for advantage calculation.

---

## 4. Reward Function

- **Chess Engine Evaluation**

  - Parse the move from `<answer>` and feed it into Stockfish.
  - Stockfish returns an evaluation (e.g., +1.5 means a better position for White).
  - Convert that numeric eval into a reward, e.g., `reward = engine_eval / scaling_factor`.

- **Validity & Formatting Checks**

  - If the move is invalid or the model omits `<answer></answer>` tags, `reward = 0`.

- **Optional**
  - Small bonus for a chain-of-thought that meets length or formatting criteria.

---

## 5. Training Loop (GRPO / PPO)

1. **Sampling**

   - Use `model.generate()` to produce _G_ responses per position (prompts from your dataset).

2. **Compute Rewards**

   - Evaluate each response with Stockfish + format checks.

3. **Calculate Advantages**

   - \(A_i = \frac{r_i - \mu(r)}{\sigma(r)}\) (group-based)

4. **Policy Update**

   - Pass `(prompts, responses, advantages)` to the PPO/GRPO step.
   - Apply a KL penalty to avoid policy collapse.

5. **Repeat**
   - Iterate for many RL steps/epochs, sampling new responses from the updated policy each time.

---

## 6. Hyperparameters & Logging

- **Key Hyperparams**

  - Batch size
  - Number of responses per position (G)
  - KL coefficient (`β`)
  - Learning rate

- **Logging**
  - Track average reward, advantage, engine evaluations, etc.
  - Evaluate the model periodically (e.g., sample test positions).

---

## 7. Practical Tips

- **Start Small**

  - Test on fewer board states or a shallow engine depth first.

- **Checkpointing**

  - Save model states frequently.

- **Validate**

  - Check that the final moves are indeed improving over time and that the chain-of-thought is not nonsense.

- **Costs**
  - Watch out for GPU usage and time spent calling Stockfish.
